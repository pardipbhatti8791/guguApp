# guguApp

This angular 2 app is integrated with webpack. Webpack is a module bundler. It takes in a bunch of assets (ie. source, images, markup, CSS, ...) and turns that into something you can provide to the client.

To use please follow below mention ways.

Clone the repo.

# Then navigate to app directory and  install all modules using : 
        
        sudo npm install .

# Development Build: 

    npm start (This will lanch app in development mode)

# Production Build:

    npm run build (This will generate separate dist folder for production.)
